# HackThisSite_Writeups

HackThisSite.org is a free, safe and legal training ground for hackers to test and expand their ethical hacking skills with challenges, CTFs, and more.

This repository includes every HackThisSite challenge I have completed.
For each write-up, I will describe the challenge, the objective, and the description of the solution.
